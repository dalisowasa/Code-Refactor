# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

In this challenge, I am refactoring an existing site to make it more accessible. Starter code has already been provided. My responsibility is to make sure that all links are functioning correctly. I will also rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
